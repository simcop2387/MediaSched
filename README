I won't claim this will work for anyone else yet.

There's a simple config.yml file here, should be mostly self explanitory.

statefile: tv.state
defaultlist: masterdefault.lst
storage:
        - /mnt/server/pub/Movies/
        - /mythtv/record/
        - /mythtv2/record/
        - /mnt/ryans/torrents/
        - /home/music/television/defaults/
calendar: http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/pipnb40ro3uhnce0oc36a0n0sk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
timezone: America/New_York

statefile is where we keep track of the past, this is necessary right now (that will change).
defaultlist is the default when there isn't anything scheduled, will make this nicer in the future, this is looked for in the storage directories
storage is where we look to find any of the files we're after, videos, playlists, directories themselves, etc.
calendar is where we can find an ical formatted file that tells us what we play
timezone is the local timezone, this is to make sure that things all line up correctly
